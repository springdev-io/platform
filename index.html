{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring IO is a cohesive, versioned platform for building modern applications. It is a modular,
enterprise-grade distribution that delivers a curated set of dependencies while keeping
developers in full control of deploying only the parts they need. Spring IO is 100% open source,
lean, and modular.

### End of Life

The Platform will reach the end of its supported life on 9 April 2019. Maintenence
releases of both the Brussels and Cairo lines will continue to be published up until that
time. Users of the Platform are encourage to start using Spring Boot's dependency
management directory, either by using spring-boot-starter-parent as their Maven project's
parent, or by importing the spring-boot-dependencies bom.

### 特性

 - One platform, many workloads - build web, integration, batch, reactive or big data applications
 - Radically simplified development experience with Spring Boot
 - Production-ready features provided out of the box
 - Curated and harmonized dependencies that just work together
 - Modular platform that allows developers to deploy only the parts they need
 - Support for embedded runtimes, classic application server, and PaaS deployments
 - Depends only on Java SE, and supports Groovy, Grails and some Java EE
 - Works with your existing dependency management tools such as Maven and Gradle
 - The Spring IO Platform is certified to work on JDK 7 and 8<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup>While the Spring IO Platform supports JDK 7 and 8, many individual Spring
projects also support older JDK versions. Please refer to the [individual projects' documentation]
(http://spring.io/docs) for the specific minimum requirements.

### 使用Platform

The Spring IO platform provides versions of the various Spring projects and their dependencies. With the
configuration shown above added to your build script, you're ready to declare your dependencies without
having to worry about version numbers:

#### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'org.springframework:spring-core'
}
```
